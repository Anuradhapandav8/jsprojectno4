The tram station was at the Main Road, and the tram reached the Nashik Road railway station via the present Main Road, Bhadrakali Market, Ghasbazar, and Phalke Road. It covered a distance of about eight to ten kilometres, and the stretch used to be covered with dense jungle at the time. In the article ‘Nashik-then’, poet Kusumagraj has written passionately about trams. He writes, If the carriages were full, the tram would leave. It would ring the bell and drive out of the village to the main road and then to the grass market.[25]"
